#security 

Is a proxy that allows the admin user to protect the apps deployed on multiple GCP services so they are only available for users with certain [[Identity Access Management]] policies applied.

We can also retrieve the authenticated users by the following headers:

- ``X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Email``
- ``X-Goog-Authenticated-User-Id``
